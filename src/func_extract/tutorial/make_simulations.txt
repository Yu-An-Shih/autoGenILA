=== Making simulation files

Basically we will use the other executable programs generated during the build process to help automating the process of making simulation files.
Readers are encouraged to read the programs in func_extract/app to undertand how to use these executables.

1. move *.ll and link.sh into ILA_SIM folder

2. Generate the random instructions to be tested:
   run ./build/test_gen (with arg: instrNum), it takes the instr.txt file and
   generate tb.txt file, which includes instructions to be 
   used in rtl and ila simulations.
   ATTENTIOM: change the g_design before using it!

3. Generate the ILA simulation model based on the update functions
   run ./build/sim_gen (with arg: instrNum), generate ila.cpp and ila.h file
   may need to modify the mem_rdata and mem_addr in ila.cpp
   !!! specify the mem_addr for each instruction

4. copy ila.cpp and ila.h to ILA_SIM folder

5. (1) option1: run ./build/tb_gen (with arg: instrNum) to generate rtl testbench
   (2) option2: update the memd.txt file (needs to be manually extracted from ila.c, the assignment to mem), and generate mem.txt with /app/util/a.out

6. run ./build/cmp to compare the ila_results.txt and rtl_results.txt. "ignore_asv.txt" will be read, which specified some asvs that can be ignored for comparison.
