Here are the steps for generating ILA update functions and simulation files

1. prepare the instr.txt in the test directory. If there is fifo, must make $FIFO
   prepare the necessary visited_target.txt file to skip target, and allowed_target.txt.
   prepare the rst.vcd or norm.vcd file
   

2. run ./build/func_extract, multiple will be generated:
    *.ll and *_tmp.ll
    all_regs.txt
    asv_info.txt (some "asvs" may need to be deleted for simplicity)
    func_info.txt: target and dependent registers for each function -- used to generate function declare and call
    link.sh: script for compile and link llvm ir files)

    All these files are appended, so need manual check (!!! So need to remove legacy txt in the above files)

3.  move *.ll and link.sh into ILA_SIM folder

4. run ./build/instr_gen (with arg: instrNum), it takes the instr.txt file and
   generate tb.txt file, which includes instructions to be 
   used in rtl and ila simulations.

5. run ./build/sim_gen (with arg: instrNum), generate ila.cpp and ila.h file
   may need to modify the mem_rdata and mem_addr in ila.cpp
   !!! specify the mem_addr for each instruction

6. copy ila.cpp and ila.h to ILA_SIM folder

7. (1) option1: run ./build/tb_gen (with arg: instrNum) to generate rtl testbench
   (2) option2: update the memd.txt file by ila.c, and generate mem.txt with ./rtl_sim/util.a.out
